======

I’m a PhD student at the Laboratory of Machine Learning & Health Informatics at the Computer Science and Engineering Department, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). 

My research interests lie primarily in Explainable recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, and deep learning-based Disease Diagnosis models, with an emphasis on Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, stochastic contexture bandit problem, DNN model diagnosing alcohol/nicotine use disorder using brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image datasets.

## Experience
**01/2018 - Present | Research Assistant | University of Connecticut**
<!--- * Designed graph neural networks, NLP, machine learning methods to improve drug discovery, knowledge graph completion, depression detection and so on. -->
<!--- * Supervisors: [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/) and [Prof. Fei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FjCbjDYAAAAJ&hl=en) (Advised by Prof. Wang for a year).-->
