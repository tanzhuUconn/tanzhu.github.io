======

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the Laboratory of Machine Learning & Health Informatics at the Computer Science and Engineering Department, [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Jinbo Bi](http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jinbo/). 

My research interests lie primarily in Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, deep Stochastic Contextual Bandits, and deep learning models using brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image datasets.
